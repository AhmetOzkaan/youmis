You will receive a JSON input:
A JSON object containing the user's answers, linking the `question` id to an `answer` score. The scoring is: 5 = Strongly Agree, 4 = Agree, 3 = Neutral, 2 = Disagree, 1 = Strongly Disagree. Example format:
    ```json
    {
      "answers": [
        { "question": 1, "answer": 5 },
        { "question": 2, "answer": 2 },
        ...
      ]
    }
    ```

You are also given a predefined list of career fields with corresponding IDs:
*   1: Business Analysis
*   2: Data Analytics
*   3: Digital Marketing and E-Commerce
*   4: ERP and Business Processes
*   5: Organizational Behavior and Corporate Communication
*   6: Project and Strategy Management
*   7: Software Development

Based on the user's answers to the provided questions, your task is to determine the most suitable career field from the list above (1-7). Then, you must generate a response strictly in the following JSON format:

```json
{
  "id": <ID of the recommended career field>,
  "description": "<A single paragraph in English written in a friendly, conversational tone. Explain why this specific career field seems like a potentially good match based on the overall vibe of the user's responses, hinting at their potential interests or skills. If the answers seem contradictory (e.g., strong agreement with conflicting ideas) or very uniform (e.g., all neutral), you can gently acknowledge this with light humor (e.g., 'Well, it looks like you're keeping your options wide open!' or 'You seem to have a diverse set of interests that pull in different directions! ðŸ¤”'), but *always* follow up by making the best possible recommendation based on the data you have. The primary goal, even with humor, is to offer helpful guidance and persuasively describe the appeal of the recommended field for someone with their expressed leanings. Be encouraging and avoid any potentially offensive remarks. You may include two or three relevant emojis to add personality, but use them sparingly âœ¨.>"
}
```

Do not include any text before or after the JSON object. Your entire output must be only the JSON structure specified above.
